    "## Concept Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What's the difference between a view, materialized view, and a table? When would you use each?**\n",
    "- Table\n",
    "\t- Physically stores data on disk.\n",
    "\t- Data is inserted/updated/deleted directly.\n",
    "\t- Source of truth.\n",
    "    - Use when: You need to store real data permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- View\n",
    "\t- A saved SQL query.\n",
    "\t- Does NOT store data; computed at query time.\n",
    "\t- Always shows latest data from underlying tables.\n",
    "    - Use when:\n",
    "    \t- You want a reusable query.\n",
    "    \t- You want to restrict columns for security.\n",
    "    \t- You want simplified access to complex joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Materialized View (MV)\n",
    "\t- Stores the result of a query physically (cached table).\n",
    "\t- Must be refreshed manually or on a schedule.\n",
    "\t- Faster reads, slower refresh.\n",
    "    - Use when:\n",
    "    \t- You need speed for expensive queries (reporting, analytics).\n",
    "    \t- Related data changes slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is ORM? Why do we need ORM?**\n",
    "- Object-Relational Mapping\n",
    "- a layer that lets you interact with the database using classes and objects instead of SQL.\n",
    "- Examples: SQLAlchemy (Python), Hibernate (Java), Django ORM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why we need ORM:  \n",
    "- Avoid writing raw SQL repeatedly.\n",
    "- Prevent SQL injection.\n",
    "- Database-agnostic code (switch DBs easily).\n",
    "- Automatically map rows ↔ objects.\n",
    "- Cleaner code for CRUD operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explain the ACID properties. How do they ensure database reliability?**\n",
    "ACID ensures reliability in *relational databases*.\n",
    "     \n",
    "- A – Atomicity: All steps in a transaction succeed or none do.  \n",
    "- C – Consistency: The database moves from one valid state to another valid state.    \n",
    "- I – Isolation: Transactions don’t interfere with each other.  \n",
    "- D – Durability: Once committed, data persists even after crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, ACID ensures a database is correct, predictable, and crash-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explain the CAP theorem.**\n",
    "- Consistency (all nodes see the same data)\n",
    "- Availability (every request gets a response)\n",
    "- Partition Tolerance (system operates when network fail)\n",
    " \n",
    "In distributed systems, you can only guarantee two of them during a network partition. Since partitions are unavoidable, real choice = CP vs AP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When would you choose SQL over NoSQL and vice versa?**\n",
    "Choose SQL when: \n",
    "- ACID property  \n",
    "- Strong consistency needed.\n",
    "- Complex joins/relationships.\n",
    "- Multi-row transactions needed.\n",
    "- Data is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose NoSQL when:\n",
    "- Huge amount data among several server needed.\n",
    "- Schema flexibility needed.\n",
    "- High read/write speed needed.\n",
    "- Mostly just lookup one thing by its id.\n",
    "- Distributed systems with eventual consistency allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is eventual consistency?**\n",
    "- medium consistency, high availablity, low latency\n",
    "- If no new updates occur, all replicas will eventually converge to the same value.   \n",
    "- Used in AP systems like DynamoDB, Cassandra, MongoDB (cluster mode), social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are the different consistency models in distributed systems (strong, weak, eventual)?**\n",
    "- Strong consistency: Reads always return the most recent write.\n",
    "- Weak consistency: No guarantee what version you read.\n",
    "- Eventual consistency: Given enough time, all nodes converge to the same state.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Consistency | Availability | Latency | Use Case |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| Strong | Highest | Lowest | Highest | Financial systems |\n",
    "| Eventual | Medium | Highest | Low | Social media |\n",
    "| Weak | Lowest | Highest | Lowest | Real-time streaming |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explain the difference between horizontal scaling (scaling out) and vertical scaling (scaling up).**\n",
    "**Vertical Scaling (scale up)**: Increase power of a single machine\n",
    "(CPU, RAM, storage).\n",
    "- Simple\n",
    "- Expensive at high end\n",
    "- Single point of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal Scaling (scale out)**: Add more machines (nodes).\n",
    "- Better fault tolerance\n",
    "- Unlimited scale\n",
    "- Harder architecture (needs sharding/replication)\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL systems excel here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How does MongoDB handle transactions and ACID properties?**\n",
    "- MongoDB is natively ACID for single-document operations \n",
    "- provides full ACID multi-document transactions since 4.0.\n",
    "- However, heavy transaction use is discouraged because it hurts scalability, and embedding documents is the preferred design.\n",
    "- MongoDB supports two types of transactions:\n",
    "  - Single-document transactions (default, always ACID): embedding related data into a single document\n",
    "  - Multi-document transactions (like SQL):\n",
    "    - Use a multi-statement session\n",
    "\t- All writes are staged\n",
    "\t- The whole batch is committed atomically\n",
    "\t- On failure, the entire transaction rolls back \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is sharding in databases? How does it differ from partitioning?**   \n",
    "**Partitioning**  \n",
    "Splitting a large table into smaller pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types:\n",
    "\t•\tRange partitioning\n",
    "\t•\tHash partitioning\n",
    "\t•\tList partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding (distributed partitioning)**\n",
    "- Partitioning across multiple machines.\n",
    "- Every shard = a subset of data + its own storage + often its own replica set.\n",
    "- All sharding is partitioning, but not all partitioning is sharding.\n",
    "- Use sharding when:\n",
    "\t- Data is too large for one server.\n",
    "\t- You need horizontal scaling.\n"
