    "Flask is based on **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)**\n",
    "- Programming Model: **Synchronous** and blocking. \n",
    "- Concurrency: Limited, as it relies on threads and doesn't handle many simultaneous connections as efficiently. \n",
    "- Protocols: Supports HTTP only.\n",
    "- Use Case: Best for traditional, I/O-bound or CPU-bound applications that don't require real-time features. \n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is based on **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)**\n",
    "- Programming Model: **Asynchronous** and non-blocking, using the async/await syntax. \n",
    "- Concurrency: Excellent for handling thousands of simultaneous connections with a single process. \n",
    "- Protocols: Supports HTTP, WebSockets, and can be extended for other protocols. \n",
    "- Use Case: Ideal for modern, high-performance web apps needing real-time features, such as chat applications, streaming services, and games.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So it is called the FAST api.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, either can handle heavy CPU bound tasks."

    "## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Route Handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular function (synchronous):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get('/tasks/{task_id}')\n",
    "def get_task(task_id: int):\n",
    "    # Blocking operation - server waits here\n",
    "    return {\"task_id\": task_id}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    # Non-blocking - server can handle other requests\n",
    "    result = await some_async_operation()\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call a blocking (synchronous) function in an async route, it can block the event loop and affect other tasks. The best approach is to use async def with async operations directly. If you must run blocking code, you can wrap it with asyncio.to_thread() that convert synchronous functions to threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `def` (synchronous) when:**\n",
    "- Working with **traditional databases (synchronous SQLAlchemy)**\n",
    "- Performing CPU-bound operations\n",
    "- **No I/O** operations or all I/O is synchronous\n",
    "- Most simple CRUD operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `async def` (asynchronous) when:**\n",
    "- Making **external API calls** (like weather forecast APIs)\n",
    "- Operations that involve waiting for external services\n",
    "- Using **async database** drivers (**sqlalchemy[asyncio]**)\n",
    "- Handling file uploads/downloads\n",
    "- Working with WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example from WeatherForecastTaskMgt\n",

    "@app.get(\"/tasks/{task_id}\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `async def` declares an asynchronous function\n",
    "- `db.get()` is blocking/synchronous.   \n",
    "  Since the route is async def, this <u>does block the event loop</u> while querying the database. FastAPI doesn’t automatically run this in a thread. For heavy DB operations, you could wrap it with `await asyncio.to_thread(db.get, Task, task_id)`.\n",
    "- `forecast_client.get_weather` is async   \n",
    "- `await` pauses execution until the async operation completes, without blocking the event loop, allowing other requests to be processed\n",

    "# Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FastAPI is batteries-included**: Comes with validation, documentation, and type checking out of the box\n",
    "2. **Use async strategically**: Only for I/O-bound operations like external API calls\n",
    "3. **Pydantic handles validation**: Define schemas once, get validation and documentation automatically\n",
    "4. **Documentation is free**: Swagger UI and ReDoc are generated automatically from your code\n",
    "5. **Testing is straightforward**: Use TestClient for sync code, AsyncClient for async code\n",
