    "### **What's the difference between using requests and httpx for making HTTP calls in FastAPI, and why is httpx preferred in async contexts?**\n",
    "- `requests` is a **synchronous** HTTP client, it blocks the thread while waiting for a response.  \n",
    "- `httpx` supports **both synchronous and asynchronous** calls (`async/await`). In FastAPI, which is async-friendly, `httpx` is preferred because it allows non-blocking HTTP requests, improving performance and scalability.\n",
